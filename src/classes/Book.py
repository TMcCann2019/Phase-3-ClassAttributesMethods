# define a class Book with 4 properties: title, author, page_count
# define a class attribute all that stores all objects
    # when should this attribute be initialized? when should it be used?
# define 3 class methods: get_all_books that returns all books,
#                         get_avg_page_count that returns the mean page count
#                         get_longest that returns the longest book
    # what are two ways of defining these class methods?
